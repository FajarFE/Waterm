        {
          "question": "Can I integrate existing devices with different protocols?",
          "answer": "Yes, our platform supports various integration methods. For devices using standard protocols like MQTT, HTTP, or WebSockets, you can use our API endpoints directly. For proprietary protocols, we offer gateway solutions that can translate between protocols. Additionally, our platform provides webhook integrations for third-party services."
        },

          "question": "How secure is the connection between my devices and the platform?",
          "answer": "All communication between your devices and our platform is encrypted using TLS/SSL. We implement device authentication using unique API keys or certificates, and all data is transmitted securely. Our platform also supports additional security features like IP whitelisting and two-factor authentication for the dashboard."

        {
          "question": "How does the fish monitoring system work?",
          "answer": "Our aquaculture monitoring system uses specialized sensors to track water quality parameters (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, ammonia levels), fish behavior patterns, and feeding metrics. The platform collects this data in real-time and provides analytics to optimize fish health and growth."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I set fish monitoring thresholds?",
          "answer": "In the \"Monitoring Settings\" section, select your aquaculture project and navigate to \"Thresholds.\" Here, you can set specific parameters for each monitored value. For example, you can define acceptable ranges for water temperature, oxygen levels, and pH. When readings fall outside these ranges, the system will trigger alerts based on your notification preferences."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can the system monitor different fish species with different needs?",
          "answer": "Yes, our platform allows you to create species-specific profiles with different monitoring parameters. You can set up multiple monitoring zones within the same location, each with its own thresholds and alert settings. This is particularly useful for facilities raising multiple species with varying environmental requirements."

          "question": "Does the platform provide predictive analytics for fish health?",
          "answer": "Yes, our premium plans include predictive analytics that use historical data and machine learning to forecast potential issues before they become critical. The system can predict water quality trends, detect subtle changes in fish behavior that might indicate disease, and recommend preventive actions to maintain optimal conditions for your aquaculture operation."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does the fish counting and biomass estimation feature work?",
          "answer": "Our platform uses computer vision technology via underwater cameras to estimate fish count and biomass. The system can track growth rates over time, helping you optimize feeding schedules and harvest times. This feature requires compatible underwater camera equipment and is available on our advanced subscription plans."
